I'm not a graphic designer -- obviously. That said, I wanted a new 5' x 3' flag for my home in Washington. The Washington State flag has George Washington which as great as he was for our country, was still a slave holder. So instead of removing George from the sign I chose to find some base Washington State logos and build from them even though they are not the official Washington State logos. 

I created both a City of Bothell one as well as one for King County (which uses the MLK logo of the county).
